Greetings and salutations! My name is Brennen Constable. I program in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and Python. I would like to learn C/++, Java, and would like to someday create a programming language and an operating system of my own. I also enjoy making simple text-based games in Batch script on FreeDOS.
