Hi, I'm @FourGeniuses! I program in HTML (although it's a markup language, not a programming language), CSS (again, not really programming), Javascript, PHP, SQL (query language), and Python. I would like to learn C, C++, and Java. I would like to someday create a programmong language and an operating system of my own.
